1) There should be a hoop on the right side of the screen and a basketball on the left side.

Can you create a level two for the Memory Memoir game, when the user clicks into the game it will bring them to a 5 by 6 square rectangular white grid, this game will be split into 5 levels with each level having three rounds. The first level will start off with 3 squares lighting up cherry pink for 1 second, then returning back to normal after the second. The user has to click three squares which will light up, and then press the enter button to lock in their answer, if they click a lit up square it will unlight. If the user clicks the enter button and all three lit up squares are the ones originially flashed, then the next round will start in three seconds. I'll discribe the next round in the next prompt.
