Can you create a level two for the Memory Memoir game, when the user clicks into the game it will bring them to a 5 by 6 square rectangular white grid, this game will be split into 5 levels with each level having three rounds. The first level will start off with 3 squares lighting up cherry pink for 1 second, then returning back to normal after the second. The user has to click three squares which will light up, and then press the enter button to lock in their answer, if they click a lit up square it will unlight. If the user clicks the enter button and all three lit up squares are the ones originially flashed, then the next round will start in three seconds. I'll discribe the next round in the next prompt.

Can you make it so that when the user enter's their own code they will be brought to a screen that has A = then a blank space that the user can fill in on their own, and then B = then C =. And so on until Z. Also the user is allowed to input another letter in the blank space, meaning that these letters will replace the other when it is needed. There will also be a numbers section from 0 to 9 but it is optional, and a check mark box for the game to know if the player wants to use punctuation or not, if yes then it will give an option to fill in the ciphers for the punctuation but this is also optional. I will elaborate on how the practice will work in my next prompt

Please create a cards game called 24 using html and javascript. Following are the requirments:
1) Make the style smooth and like a poker table
2) When the user clicks into 24 from my portfolio, bring them to a title page with a prominant 24 being displayed as well as piles of cards on a poker table in the background. Underneath the 24 will be two options, Solo or Multiplayer
3)When clicking into multiplayer mode, have two decks of 26 cards, one deck right above the middle of the left side of the screen which will look like an empty poker table and one on the right right above the middle as well, the cards are to be in the style of the standard Bicycle playing cards and are to be facing down so the players will only see the back of the cards
4)Solo mode will have the same stylization, I will add the features on in later prompts, just get the looks for now
